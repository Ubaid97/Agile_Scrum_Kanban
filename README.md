# Agile, Scrum, and Kanban

## Agile
### The 4 principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

## Scrum
- Scrum is a framework used for developing, delivering and deploying 
products. it allows teams to divide the work into weekly quotas, the end 
product of each of which must meet an agreed upon definition of done
- it's useful for agile because it enables to continuous production of 
deliverables and facilitates rapid feeback and improvement

### Scrum roles
- Scrum master - orchestrates the scrum meetings, ensures transparency 
and that all issues are addressed,
- Product owner - Represents the needs of the client
- Development team - team working in the sprint

### Scrum artefacts
- Product backlog - list of everything needed for the product
- Sprint backlog - list of everything a team plans to achieve in a given 
sprint
- potentially releasable product increment - the team must have a 
product increment that is potentially releasable at the end of every 
sprint

### Scrum ceremonies
- Sprint planning - meeting before starting a sprint to determine the 
aims of that sprint
- Daily stand-up - daily review to ensure transparency. Members share 
what they've been working on and any troubles they may have encountered
- Sprint review - reviewing the functionality of the product at the end 
of every sprint
- Sprint retrospective - reviewing how the team worked during the last 
sprint, what went well and what can be improved

### 3 Amigos
- Business - identifying problem to be solved
- Development - How a solution might be built
- Testing - Testing the system's behaviour and whether it meets the 
acceptance criteria

### INVEST
- Independent
- Negotiable
- Valuable
- Estimable
- Small
- Testable

## Epic and User stories
### Epic stories
- An epic story is usually one big piece of product functionality which 
can be broken down into smaller stories
- A use case is a description of a particular functionality will be 
implemented. It will include the agents performing actions (eg users) 
and the system's behaviour, detailing the sequence of steps the agents 
will need to take in order to fulfill the goal of the functionality

### User stories
- User stories express needs that users have. they will typically 
consist 
of a certain functioniality users will want to perform (eg send email).
- Use cases will describe the sequence of steps the agents will need to 
take, and how the system will need behave in response, in order to meet 
the need in the user story

### How these relate to Agile and Scrum
- In an Agile environment, scrum is a very useful framework to adopt, 
and scrum will split the workload into sprints. each sprint will have 
certain functionalities to be implemented as their goal.
- Epic stories consist of quite large and complex functionalities which 
usually cannot be completed in a single sprint
- Instead, epic stories are broken down into smaller user stories, which 
can be completed in a single sprint.
- Use cases will then outline what these functionalities consist of

## Kanban
- A framework for implementing agile
- Divides workload into work completed, work being done, and work to be 
done
- focus on small incremental changes
- seeks to minimise disruption by continuing the current way of doing 
things, implementing small changes
- It's highly flexible and facilitates continous incremental change, 
making it useful in an agile environment
- Unlike scrum, which requires planning and organisation around a 
specific schedule, kanban can be applied to existing workflows without 
disruption
- Should be used when a team is looking for a non-disruptive framework 
that ensures high flexibility and transparency
